Welcome to Statsfy!

Statsfy is a Spotify based app that allows you to take a deep look into your listening stats and discover new music!
It consists of a Home screen where you can take a look at your stats, Recommendation screens to discover new music, and a Settings screen for your personal information.
This app was primarily developed on a Windows machine. Running it on an Android emulator would be best for the proportions.
In case the song preview doesn't play in the Recommendation page, do open it through "My Device" as Login is not possible through the Web.

To start, you can simply press the Login button. These are the credentials to log in to the app in this build:
User email: statsfy.dev@gmail.com
User password: CM3050MobileDevelopment
Back-up password : UOLMobileDevelopment
Back-up password 2: Statsfy.dev123

Spotify usually request to change passwords if it detects multiple logins. This is why there are back up passswords.
THANK YOU FOR READING! :)

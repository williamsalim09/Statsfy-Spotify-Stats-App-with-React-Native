Welcome to Statsfy!

Statsfy is a Spotify based app that allows you to take a deep look into your listening stats and discover new music!
It consists of a Home screen where you can take a look at your stats, Recommendation screens to discover new music, and a Settings screen for your personal information.
This app was primarily developed on a Windows machine. Running it on an Android emulator would be best for the proportions.
In case the song preview doesn't play in the Recommendation page, do open it through "My Device" as Login is not possible through the Web.
